                <p><em><b>1. Keep good records of the workplace and checks conducted</b>
                    Records and regular inspections are important in catering as they provide a consistent record of past incidents and food deliveries. It is best practice to label food with dates and ensuring proper stock rotation to ensure that produce is always fresh and within the usable period.
                    
                    When it comes to food production, best practice also stipulates that cooking temperatures and reheating temperatures should be clearly shown and labelled on all food items. Remember, for food to be deemed safe and free of all bacteria it must be stored below 5 degrees Celsius, and when heated it should reach temperatures above 60 degrees.</em></p>

                <p><em><b>2. Keep in mind the rules that must be followed regarding food hygiene</b>
                    Compliance is important here as the foodâ€™s standards agency does have the ability to close your workplace if you are deemed to not be compliant with health and safety standards. For instance, all members of staff who handle food should have the relevant level 2 food hygiene certificate. This not only makes you compliant it also helps make your workplace safer for staff members and customers.
                    
                    However, it is worth stating that in the UK the responsibility for staff training falls under the remit of the employer. This means good on the job training can be enough to ensure the employees are trained in the eyes of the law. You should adopt a two-pronged approach with certification and practical training to get the best results. It is also worth considering whether you should have public liability insurance if an incident does occur.</em></p>

                    The work surfaces within a kitchen are crucial when it comes to keeping food safe. Constant sanitization and the prevention of cross-contamination will help keep your food and your workplace safe. The food standards agency recommends having separate colour-coded chopping boards for different food types. The most common method is as follows:</p><br>
                    
                    <li>Red = raw meat</li>
                    
                   <li> Yellow = cooked meat</li>
                    
                    <li>Brown = vegetables</li>
                    
                   <li> Green = salad</li>
                    
                   <li> Blue = raw seafood</li>
                    
                   <li> White = dairy</li>
                    
                    <li>Purple = nuts</li>
                    
                   <p> All chopping boards within a kitchen should be properly cleaned after service and stored in a dry clean environment. For good health and safety compliance, you should avoid cutting or handling food directly on a metallic surface.

        <p><em><b>The health and safety inspection checklist</b>
            Health and safety inspections are routinely carried out around the UK as a way of ensuring standards are maintained across the industry. Checks should occur roughly every 6 months, giving you ample time to prepare and make sure you are operating a safe environment.<br><br>
            
            Here we have compiled a checklist on some areas to consider that will be evaluated during an inspection</em></p>
